1.	Twice volume 
2.	Half the volume 
3.	No change. 
4.	Lower pitch 
5.	It creates a random drop in pitch of a value less than or equal to 0.1. This leads to weird noise as each waveform is different from the others then. 
6.	We hear totally random noise as the new pitch is now completely independent of the original song. 
7.	The music is out of sync with the words. 
8.	The pitch of the new waveform is related to the original pitch of it and the pitch of the previous waveform. 
9.	This results in each waveform being more stretched out over time.
